# Linear-Regression-Analysis
This repository takes an in-depth regression of mtcars dataset in R.
This analysis attempts understand the mtcars dataset in R structurally as well as what effect the rest of the independent variables in the dataset have on the miles per gallon in the vehicle- our dependent variable.
We go ahead and add non-linear relationships as well as binary relationships in the dataset to attempt to improve the performance of our linear model.
There is also an interaction effect with the quarter mile per second acceleration and the weight of the vehicles , in order to understand the effect that this has on the miles per gallon of the vehicles in the dataset.
